<h3><i>clusk.net</i></h3>
today i made clusk.net <a href="../index.html"><p>[aka this site]</p></a>

it's just html, pretty much as simple as it gets.

it's got me thinking about sites in general.  what makes a website good lately?  the features, responsiveness, mobile friendliness, etc. i think the problem with the modern web [and modern design as of late] is that it's become incredibly uniform.  
you go to one dot com or another.  or a phone app or another.  sure the site does something differnet but they all look the same.  they all feel the same.  and the tools used are mostly onwed by some other company or another.  had a chat with the CEO of <a href="https://www.vienna.earth">vienna hypertext</a> yesterday. they're doing cool work over there, there's tons more to do around the entire web.
every site is using AWS.  every site is using react/nextjs.  like music, every website is becoming the same site. working with john smith from <a href=https://chadnet.org>chadnet.org</a> also has me thinking.  the site is not flashy but is a bit elegant imo.  has everything it needs.  it's intuitive, user-centric, high enough performance.

on this unemployment journey, i set out to create some new company, etc.  during my time in El Salvador [and generally the past couple years], i realized something fairly quickly.  a massive gap in the short-term / "airbnb" market.  not for apartment/hotel/condo availability.  airbnb has plenty of those. everyone has a spare room or basement they want to rent out.  but payment options.  if I want to use bitcoin, where can I stay?  I could log onto bitrefill, buy an airbnb gift card or marriott gift card and book a place.  it's not a terrible option.  
in fact, it's probably the best one out there at the moment.
but that step in between, purcahisng from bitrefill, adding the gift card, etc.  it's a hassle that isn't required elsewhere.  plus, this only addresses the payer.  what about the host?  what if they want to accept bitcoin directly?  but airbnb [and other services like vrbo, etc.] do not allow them to natively accept bitcoin [there's also a market for stablecoins].
</p>

maybe i should maek an airbnb web listing site for bitcoin ppl that looks like this.
